# Hey, I’m Lars Talian

Rust / C++ systems engineer working on real-time robotics, ML infrastructure, and data platforms. I study **Computer Science at NTNU** (M.Sc.) and will be on exchange at **UC Berkeley**.

I’m a Software Engineer at **OmniMod** (MARL-controlled parcel-sorting robots) and co-founder of **Humanoid Labs NTNU**, where I lead a **C++/Rust/ROS 2** humanoid stack. Previously, I was Group Lead for **Data Engineering at Revolve NTNU** (Formula Student).

**Projects:**  
MARL planner + infra for real-time parcel-sorting robots (3× faster inference, 30× faster CI), 250+ sensor car telemetry platform and race dashboards for a championship Formula Student team, Humanoid Labs C++/Rust/ROS 2 stack for humanoid/quadruped robots (sim, control, perception), **Running Jockey** (generate run & cycling workouts – https://runningjockey.com), **breakdown** (self-improving team manager agent, 3rd OpenAI × ElevenLabs hackathon), **planetlens** (climate and population analysis tool, Start Hack UN track finalists).

**Recognitions:**  
3rd OpenAI × ElevenLabs Hackathon ’25 (only team invited to OpenAI HQ), Winner Tech:Europe Stockholm Hackathon ’25, Overall Winner Formula Student Netherlands ’24 (13 podiums across 3 competitions), Start Hack St. Gallen UN Track Finalists ’24.

“I care about systems that still behave at race pace, not just in the demo.”
